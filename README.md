# ChatGPT for desktop
This is a simple app that makes ChatGPT live in your menubar.

I forked this it make it not collide with all my shortcuts. 

I did it by changing the shortcut in index.js. Electron has a nice overview [here](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/accelerator) 

I also removed notarize from foirge.config.js as I do not plan to distribute this app.I am only building for myself

When i installed electron-forge and build the app with:

```
npm install electron-forge
npm run make
```
